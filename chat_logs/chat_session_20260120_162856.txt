==============================

[GM] You step out of the telephone booth and into the bustling streets of Vienna, a city alive with the sounds of trams clattering over the cobblestones and the chatter of pedestrians going about their day. It is a warm day on June 15, 1936, and the sun casts a golden hue over the historic buildings that encompass the University of Vienna, a hub of intellectual activity and political unrest. Scholars and students are engaged in animated discussions, with some passionately debating the rise of fascism and the implications of anti-Semitic sentiment that is beginning to pervade Austrian society. The air is thick with tension, a stark contrast to the beauty of the architecture around you.

You notice a group of students nearby, some of whom appear to be followers of the nationalist movements that are gaining traction in the country. Their laughter is tinged with a sense of urgency, as if they are waiting for something momentous to occur. 

As you take in your surroundings, you must decide your next course of action:

1. Approach the group of students and engage them in conversation about current political events.
2. Head towards the main entrance of the University and observe the interactions of faculty members and students.
3. Search for a local newspaper stand to gather information about recent news concerning Moritz Schlick.
4. Explore the nearby streets to get a better sense of the neighborhood and its atmosphere.
