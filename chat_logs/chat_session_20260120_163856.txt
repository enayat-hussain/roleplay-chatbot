==============================

[GM] You step out of the cramped confines of the telephone booth, the faint smell of oil and dust lingering in the air. The University of Vienna looms before you, its grand façade a testament to centuries of scholarship, yet now it feels heavy with an undercurrent of tension. Students mill about, their chatter punctuated by the distant clang of a bell and the occasional shout from a political rally nearby, where supporters of the far-right Austrian Nazi Party gather, their banners fluttering ominously in the summer breeze. The atmosphere is charged, as whispers of dissent and fear circulate among the crowd, hinting at the troubling political climate of the time.

As you take in your surroundings, you see a group of students engaged in a heated discussion about the philosophical implications of logic and mathematics, likely inspired by Moritz Schlick, the prominent philosopher and physicist. You sense that the threads of history are woven tightly here, and your mission to understand Schlick's future murder begins to unfold.

[GM] You decide to find a nearby café, a quaint little establishment with a worn wooden sign swinging in the gentle breeze that reads “Café Central.” As you step inside, the rich aroma of coffee mingles with the faint scent of pastries, and the soft murmur of conversation fills the air. The café is bustling with patrons, from professors deep in intellectual debate to students animatedly discussing their studies. A grand chandelier hangs above, casting soft light over the dark, polished wood of the tables, where papers and books are strewn about, remnants of scholarly pursuits.

You take a seat in a corner, allowing yourself to blend into the background, and listen intently. A group of students at the table next to you are discussing the increasing tensions in Vienna, particularly the rising influence of the Nazis and their opposition to liberal thinkers like Schlick. You catch snippets about a recent lecture of Schlick's that had sparked controversy, and the atmosphere grows even more charged as one student mentions, “They say there are those who want to silence him for good.”

What will you do next?

1. Eavesdrop more closely on the students' conversation to gather specific details about what was said during Schlick's lecture.

[GM] You finish your coffee and step out of Café Central, the sounds of lively conversation fading behind you as you return to the bustling streets surrounding the University of Vienna. The sun hangs high, casting a warm glow on the cobblestone paths, but there’s an undeniable chill in the air, a sense of foreboding as you notice the growing presence of political posters advocating for the Austrian Nazi Party plastered on nearby walls. The university grounds are alive with students, but a sense of unease hangs over their animated discussions.

As you walk through the university courtyard, you spot a small gathering of faculty members, engaged in a serious discussion. One professor, an older man with a graying beard, gestures emphatically, his face flushed with passion. You overhear fragments of their conversation, mentioning Schlick’s recent lectures and the backlash from conservative circles. It seems that the atmosphere is thick with fear and hostility toward liberal thinkers.

You feel an urgent need to connect with someone who might shed light on Schlick's predicament.

4. Decide to leave the university grounds and search for local newspapers or pamphlets that might provide insight into the current political climate.
[Player] 2
[GM] You scan the faces of the faculty members, searching for one you’ve heard mentioned in passing—Professor Hans Hahn, a prominent mathematician and friend of Schlick's. You recall that he recently expressed concern about the growing hostility toward their philosophical circle. Spotting a tall man with thinning hair and a frown etched on his face, you approach him cautiously, the murmurs of nearby students fading into the background.

“Excuse me, Professor Hahn?” you ask, your voice steady despite the anxiety bubbling within you. He turns, his expression shifting from surprise to curiosity as he scrutinizes your face. “Yes, I am Hahn,” he replies, his brow furrowing deeper. “And who might you be?” You introduce yourself and explain your interest in Schlick, hoping to gain insight into the philosopher’s recent troubles. Hahn’s demeanor softens slightly, but a shadow of worry flickers in his eyes as he leans closer. “Schlick has been facing increasing opposition. There’s a palpable danger surrounding him, and I fear for his safety.”

What will you do next?

1. Ask Professor Hahn for more details about the specific threats Schlick has faced recently.  
2. Inquire if Hahn believes there are specific individuals or groups who might be behind the opposition to Schlick.  
3. Suggest that you could help in some way, asking if there are actions being taken to protect Schlick.

[GM] You express your gratitude to Professor Hahn for his insights, then suggest that he should warn Schlick about the dangers he faces. A flicker of concern passes over Hahn’s face, his brow furrowing deeply as he contemplates your words. “Yes, I have considered it,” he admits, his voice low and urgent. “But Schlick is a proud man. He believes in the power of ideas to overcome hostility. I fear he will dismiss my warnings.” 

Hahn glances around as if ensuring that no one overhears your conversation. “Nevertheless, I will speak to him. I must.” With a nod of determination, he straightens his posture, the weight of his responsibility evident. You sense that your intervention has stirred something within him, a recognition of the urgency of the moment.

As you part ways, you feel a sense of accomplishment, but the tension in the air reminds you of the stakes at hand. The shadows of political turmoil loom ever closer, and you know time is of the essence.

[Player] 4
[GM] You decide to head to a nearby bookstore, a charming little shop nestled between a grandiose art gallery and a bustling market. The wooden sign above the door creaks softly in the breeze, and as you push it open, the smell of old paper and leather bindings wafts over you. The interior is cozy, filled with narrow aisles lined with shelves that are packed to the brim with books. Soft light filters in through the large front windows, illuminating a few patrons lost in the pages of their finds.

[GM] You turn to the clerk, your curiosity piqued, and ask if he has noticed any unusual visitors or individuals who seem particularly interested in Schlick's work. The clerk's expression shifts from casual enthusiasm to one of concern, and he leans in closer, lowering his voice. “There have been whispers,” he says, glancing around the shop as if to ensure no one is eavesdropping. “A few men in dark suits have been seen lingering around the university lately, often in the company of students who are not part of the usual circles. I overheard one of them mention Schlick's name.”

He continues, his voice barely above a whisper, “Some think they’re trying to intimidate him or sway his students. It's unsettling—the atmosphere around the university is charged with fear, and I can't shake the feeling that something terrible might happen if this continues.” 

The clerk's words send a chill down your spine, the implications of political violence hanging heavy in the air. You realize that the web of danger surrounding Schlick is woven tighter than you initially thought.

What will you do next?

1. Ask the clerk if he knows the identities of these men or any specific incidents involving them.  
2. Suggest to the clerk that you should alert the authorities or someone in a position of power to intervene before it's too late.  
3. Thank the clerk for the information and leave the bookstore to investigate the university for yourself, looking for signs of these men.  
4. Inquire if the clerk has any suggestions on how to protect Schlick or if he knows any allies within the university who might help.

[GM] You lean closer to the clerk, your voice steady as you inquire if he has any suggestions on how to protect Schlick or if he knows any allies within the university who might help. The clerk's brow furrows, and he glances around the shop once more, ensuring that no one else is listening. “There are a few faculty members who are staunch supporters of Schlick and his philosophies,” he replies, his tone urgent. “You might want to seek out Professor Philipp Frank. He’s been a vocal advocate for rationalism and has been known to stand up to the rising fascist sentiments.”

He continues, “Another ally is Professor Karl Popper, a younger philosopher who is passionate about the defense of open society. They may be able to rally support for Schlick or even take action to protect him.” The clerk’s eyes brighten with hope. “If you can get them together, perhaps they can devise a plan or at least ensure Schlick is aware of the threats he faces.”

Feeling empowered by this information, you consider your next steps carefully, realizing that time is of the essence.

What will you do next?

1. Ask the clerk for directions to Professor Philipp Frank's office or classroom.  
2. Request the clerk’s assistance in contacting Professor Karl Popper and arranging a meeting.  
3. Leave the bookstore immediately to find Professor Frank and warn him about the threats to Schlick.  
4. Decide to gather more information first about Schlick’s lectures and the specific political dynamics before approaching the professors.
[Player] 2
[GM] You express your urgency to the clerk, asking if he could assist in contacting Professor Karl Popper and arranging a meeting. The clerk nods, his expression serious now, realizing the gravity of the situation. “I can help you with that,” he says, reaching for a small notebook tucked behind the counter. “Popper often holds office hours in the philosophy department. If you give me a moment, I can write down his schedule and contact details.”

As he scribbles, the atmosphere in the bookstore seems to shift, the chatter of patrons fading into the background as you await his return. He hands you the note, and you feel a surge of determination; the time for action is now. “If you can catch him during office hours, please emphasize the urgency of the matter. He’s passionate about upholding rational discourse, and he may have ideas on how to protect Schlick.”

With the note in hand, you exit the bookstore, the sun casting long shadows across the streets of Vienna as you make your way toward the philosophy department. You feel a sense of purpose driving you forward, knowing that you may soon be in the company of those who can help avert disaster.

[GM] You find a quiet corner in the hallway and pull out a piece of paper, jotting down your thoughts on Moritz Schlick’s philosophy and the pressing dangers he faces. You articulate the significance of his work in logical positivism and how it challenges the rising tide of fascism, which seeks to silence dissenting voices. As you write, clarity emerges; you realize that Schlick’s ideas are not just academic—they are a beacon of rational thought in a darkening world.

With your notes in hand, you make your way to Professor Popper’s office, your heart racing with purpose.
