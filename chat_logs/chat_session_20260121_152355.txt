==============================

[GM] You find yourself standing in front of a worn, red telephone booth, its metallic surface the warm sunlight of a summer day. The year is 1936, and the air is filled with the sounds of horse-drawn carriages and the chatter of passersby. You are standing outside the main entrance of the University of Vienna, a grand building with neoclassical architecture. To your left, a bustling street market is in full swing, vendors selling fresh produce and flowers.

As you step out of the telephone booth, you feel a slight sense of disorientation. You've been sent back in time from the year 2036 to investigate the murder of Moritz Schlick, a prominent philosopher who was shot in 1936. Your mission is to uncover the events leading up to the murder.

You look around and see a group of students chatting near the entrance of the university. They are discussing the recent visit of Adolf Hitler to the Austrian Chancellor, Engelbert Dollfuss. The atmosphere is tense, and you sense a sense of unease among the students.

Here are your options:

1. Approach the students and try to eavesdrop on their conversation.
2. Enter the university to gather information about Moritz Schlick and his associates.

[GM] You decide to take a stroll through the city to get a feel for the atmosphere and people. As you walk, you notice the grand architecture of the city, a mix of Baroque and modern buildings. The streets are bustling with people, from shopkeepers to students, all going about their daily business. You pass by the famous Ringstrasse, a grand boulevard encircling the city center, and take in the sights and sounds of the vibrant city.

As you walk, you notice that the atmosphere is tense, with many people whispering about the recent visit of Adolf Hitler to the Austrian Chancellor. Some people seem to be openly discussing the visit, while others glance nervously around, as if afraid of being overheard. You see a group of Nazi sympathizers distributing flyers and propaganda, their rhetoric filled with anti-Semitic and anti-communist slogans.

You continue your stroll, taking in the sights and sounds of the city. You pass by a small café, where a group of intellectuals are engaged in heated discussion, their conversation punctuated by laughter and argument. You notice a sign on the door that reads "Kaffeehaus Philosophie", and you wonder if this might be a good place to gather information.

As you continue your walk, you notice a figure watching you from across the street. He's a tall, thin man with a pointed beard and a hat, and he seems to be studying you intently. You can't quite place him, but there's something about him that seems familiar.

Here are your options:

1. Approach the figure and try to strike up a conversation.
2. Ignore the figure and continue your stroll through the city.
3. Enter the Kaffeehaus Philosophie to gather information and join the discussion.
4. Visit the local library to research Moritz Schlick and his associates.

[GM] You decide to enter the Kaffeehaus Philosophie to gather information and join the discussion. As you step inside, you're immediately enveloped in the warm, rich atmosphere of the café. The air is thick with the smell of coffee and tobacco, and the sound of lively debate fills the air. You take a seat at a small table near the window, and order a coffee from the friendly waitress.

As you wait for your coffee to arrive, you take in the sights and sounds of the café. There's a group of students engaged in a heated discussion about the merits of Marxism, while a pair of older men sit in the corner, sipping coffee and talking in hushed tones. You notice a figure sitting at a small table in the corner, writing furiously in a notebook. He looks up and catches your eye, and you sense a flash of recognition.

As you listen, you notice a figure standing outside the café, watching the scene unfold. He's a tall, imposing man with a stern expression, and he looks like he means business. You can't quite place him, but there's something about him that seems familiar.

Here are your options:

1. Approach the group of philosophers and try to join the discussion.
2. Try to strike up a conversation with the figure watching outside the café.
3. Approach the figure writing in the notebook and try to strike up a conversation.
