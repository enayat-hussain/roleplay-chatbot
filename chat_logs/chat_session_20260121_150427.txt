[GM] You arrive in a small, cramped telephone booth, the metallic scent of the booth and the faint, musty odor of the city’s infrastructure filling your nostrils. Outside, the bustling streets of Vienna vibrate with life, a cacophony of horse-drawn carriages, the clattering of shoes against cobblestone, and the distant hum of political discourse. The University of Vienna looms nearby, its grand façade a testament to the city's rich intellectual history, while students, professors, and townsfolk mill about, engaged in fervent debate.

The year is 1936, and the atmosphere is charged with tension; the rise of Nazism in Germany is sending ripples throughout Austria, and political unrest is palpable. As you step out of the booth, you catch snippets of conversations discussing recent developments in Europe, murmurs of dissent against the government’s handling of political tensions, and the increasing influence of far-right ideologies.

You notice a group of students gathered around a bulletin board plastered with flyers and posters, some advocating for political causes while others warn against the rising tide of fascism. Nearby, a professor in a tweed jacket passionately discusses philosophical ideas with a small circle of students, gesturing animatedly as he speaks.

[GM] You confidently approach the group of students gathered around the bulletin board, their youthful energy infectious. They pause their spirited debate and direct curious glances your way as you introduce yourself and inquire about the current political climate in Austria. One tall student with disheveled hair and round glasses, clearly passionate about the subject, steps forward.

"Ah, welcome! You must be aware of the changes in Germany? The rise of Hitler is causing quite a stir here. Many of us are worried about the influence of fascist ideology spreading into Austria. Just last week, there was a protest against the government’s complacency!" He gestures towards the posters advocating civil rights and anti-fascism. "But there’s a divide among us; some believe we should align with the Nazis to avoid conflict, while others resist. It’s a tense time for our country."

The others nod in agreement, their expressions a blend of hope and fear. You sense that they hold valuable information about the political undercurrents that may have implications for your mission.

1. Ask the students for more details about the protest they mentioned and their personal views on the government.

[GM] You suggest organizing a meeting to discuss political strategies, and the group reacts with a mix of surprise and intrigue. The tall student with disheveled hair raises an eyebrow, clearly impressed by your initiative. "That’s an interesting idea! We’ve been talking about the need for more organized resistance, but it’s hard to find a common ground with so many differing opinions. If we could gather students from various factions, it might spark some real ideas!"

The others nod in agreement, and one of the female students, her expression determined, adds, "We could hold it in the student union. It’s a neutral space, and we can invite those who feel strongly about these issues." They begin discussing logistics, and you can sense a newfound excitement in the air. You realize that this meeting could not only provide you with valuable insights but also strengthen your position within the student community.

What will you do?

1. Take charge of organizing the meeting, proposing a date and time to the group.
2. Suggest inviting a prominent professor to speak at the meeting to lend credibility.
3. Offer to create flyers to promote the meeting around campus.
4. Excuse yourself and head to the student union to prepare for the meeting discreetly.

[GM] You excuse yourself from the group, feeling a sense of urgency to prepare for the meeting. As you make your way to the student union, the atmosphere is charged with anticipation, and you can already envision the diverse opinions that will converge there. Inside, you find a quiet corner to gather your thoughts and contemplate the political tensions that swirl around you.

The meeting that follows is a whirlwind of ideas, debates, and passionate pleas for action. Students from various backgrounds share their perspectives, and you listen intently, piecing together the complex tapestry of fear, hope, and ambition that defines this moment in history. As discussions unfold, you hear whispers of Moritz Schlick, a figure both revered and controversial, and you realize that the political climate is not just about ideology but also about the personal stakes involved.

With the meeting concluding, you sense that the seeds of resistance are being sown, but the specter of violence looms ever closer. The knowledge of Moritz Schlick’s impending murder weighs heavily on your mind, and you know that unraveling the reasons behind it is now more crucial than ever. You step out into the Vienna streets, determined to uncover the truth and ensure that the voices of those fighting against oppression are heard.
