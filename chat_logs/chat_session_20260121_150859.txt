==============================

[GM] The air in the telephone booth is thick with the scent of stale tobacco and ozone. Outside, the grand facade of the University of Vienna looms, its stone weathered by time. It is June 15th, 1936, and the city hums with a nervous energy, a subtle tension beneath the surface of its elegant streets. The political climate is a delicate balance, with Austria navigating a precarious path between Nazi Germany and a fragile independence. You have just arrived, the temporal displacement leaving a faint ringing in your ears.

What do you do?

1. Step out of the telephone booth and head towards the main entrance of the University.
2. Look for a newspaper stand to get a sense of current events.
3. Try to discreetly observe the people entering and leaving the university.
4. Locate a public restroom to compose yourself and check your appearance.

[GM] You find a small, utilitarian restroom just off a side corridor. The mirror is clouded, reflecting a slightly disheveled version of yourself. The stark white tiles and the faint smell of disinfectant offer a moment of grounding. You splash some cool water on your face, the shock of it helping to clear your head. The weight of your mission settles upon you – to understand the forces that will lead to Moritz Schlick's death.

What do you do next?

1. Exit the restroom and proceed towards the University's main entrance.
2. Discreetly examine the contents of your pockets and any belongings you may have.
3. Listen intently to any conversations happening nearby.
4. Attempt to find a map or directory of the University.
[Player] 3
[GM] You press your ear against the cool tile of the restroom wall, straining to catch any snippets of conversation from the corridor. The muffled sounds of footsteps and distant voices drift in. You can make out fragments – a hurried exchange about a lecture, a frustrated sigh, the clatter of a dropped book. One voice, however, stands out, speaking in hushed tones about "the professor's latest pronouncements" and "unfortunate radicalism." It's too indistinct to identify the speaker or the exact subject, but it hints at intellectual discourse, perhaps even controversy, within the university walls.

What do you do now?

1. Leave the restroom and try to identify the source of the hushed conversation.
2. Ignore the overheard snippet and head towards the University's main entrance.
3. Look for a public telephone to make a call, if you have any contacts.
4. Seek out a university employee, perhaps a janitor or administrative staff, for information.
[Player] 3
[GM] You find a public telephone on a dimly lit wall near the restroom. The Bakelite receiver feels cool and heavy in your hand. You don't have any contacts in 1936 Vienna, but the act of making a call feels like a way to orient yourself, to reach out into this unfamiliar time. You dial a random number, hoping for an answer, any answer, that might offer a clue. After a few rings, a gruff male voice answers, "Wachmann, who is this?" He sounds impatient.

What do you say?

1. "Apologies, I seem to have dialed the wrong number. Could you tell me what day it is?"
2. "Is this the Philosophy department? I'm trying to reach Professor Schlick."
3. "I'm looking for a good place to get a coffee. Can you recommend a cafe nearby?"
4. "I'm a new student, and I'm a bit lost. Could you direct me to the main lecture hall?"
[Player] 2
[GM] "Professor Schlick?" the gruff voice on the other end scoffed, a note of disdain creeping in. "You've got the wrong number, and frankly, you're wasting my time. The only thing Schlick is good for these days is stirring up trouble with his 'logical positivism'." A click echoed in your ear as the line went dead. The brief, hostile exchange offered a chilling glimpse into the animosity directed towards Schlick. It seems his philosophical ideas, so revolutionary to some, were viewed as dangerous and disruptive by others in this turbulent era. Your mission to understand the roots of his murder has just begun, and the shadows of Vienna already hold their secrets.
