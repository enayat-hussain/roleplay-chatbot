==============================

[GM] You find yourself stepping out of a battered old telephone booth, the bright Viennese sun momentarily blinding you. The University of Vienna looms before you, its imposing neo-Renaissance facade casting long shadows across the bustling courtyard. Students and professors hurry past, their voices mingling with the clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages and the occasional honk of an automobile.

The air is thick with the scent of freshly baked pastries from a nearby cafe, and the sound of a string quartet drifts out from an open window, adding to the cultural vibrancy of the scene.

You take a moment to orient yourself, realizing you've been transported back to 1936. What will you do first?

1. Approach a group of students and ask them about current events in Vienna.
2. Make your way to the university's main entrance and inquire about Moritz Schlick, the renowned philosopher.
3. Wander through the courtyard, observing the people and surroundings to get a feel for the atmosphere.
4. Locate a newspaper stand and scan the headlines for any clues about the political situation.

[GM] You decide to approach a group of students gathered in the courtyard, hoping they can provide some insight into the current events in Vienna.

As you draw closer, you notice their animated discussion, punctuated by occasional laughter and gesticulations. They appear to be debating the recent political developments, their voices carrying a mixture of excitement and concern.

"Did you hear about the Anschluss?" one student exclaims, referring to Austria's annexation by Nazi Germany earlier this year. "The Führer has made it clear that he will not tolerate any opposition to his vision for a Greater Germany."

Another student chimes in, "And what about the recent crackdown on the socialists and communists? The streets are crawling with Gestapo agents, and anyone who dares to speak out against the regime is arrested or worse."

The conversation continues, painting a picture of a city on edge, where the threat of political oppression hangs heavy in the air.

1. Express your concerns about the political situation and ask the students for more details.
2. Politely excuse yourself and make your way to the university's main entrance to inquire about Moritz Schlick.
3. Suggest that the students should be more cautious in their discussions, as the political climate seems increasingly volatile.
4. Thank the students for the information and move on, deciding to explore the courtyard further on your own.
[Player] 1
[GM] You decide to voice your concerns about the political situation to the group of students. "The annexation by Nazi Germany and the crackdown on dissidents sound quite alarming," you say, your brow furrowed with worry. "What can you tell me more about the current state of affairs in Vienna?"

The students pause for a moment, exchanging glances as they gauge your sincerity. Finally, one of them, a young woman with piercing blue eyes, steps forward.

"The situation is indeed dire," she says, her voice tinged with a mixture of fear and defiance. "The Gestapo have been raiding homes and arresting anyone they suspect of opposing the regime. Just last week, they stormed the office of a local socialist newspaper and hauled the editors away."

Another student, a lanky young man with wire-rimmed glasses, chimes in, "And did you hear about the recent attack on Professor Schlick? He's a renowned philosopher here at the university, and he's been vocal in his criticism of the Nazis."

The group falls silent, the weight of their words hanging in the air. You can sense their unease, but also a glimmer of determination in their eyes.

1. Express your sympathy for their plight and ask if there is anything you can do to help.
2. Inquire further about the attack on Moritz Schlick, hoping to learn more about the circumstances.
3. Suggest that the students should be cautious in their discussions, as the Gestapo may be monitoring their activities.
4. Thank the students for their candor and move on, deciding to explore the university grounds on your own.
[Player] 3
[GM] You decide to caution the students about the need for discretion in their discussions, given the volatile political climate.

"I understand your concerns," you say, lowering your voice to a hushed tone. "But you must be careful. The Gestapo are known to be monitoring the activities of anyone deemed a threat to the regime. I would advise you to be more discreet in your conversations, lest you draw unwanted attention."

The students exchange uneasy glances, the color draining from their faces. The young woman with the piercing blue eyes nods solemnly, her lips pressed into a thin line.

"You're right, of course," she says, her voice barely above a whisper. "We've all heard the stories of people disappearing in the night, never to be seen again. It's a risk we've been willing to take, but perhaps we should be more cautious going forward."

The group falls silent, the weight of your words sinking in. The air seems to grow colder, and the laughter and chatter that once filled the courtyard have been replaced by a palpable sense of unease.

1. Apologize for dampening their spirits and suggest a change of subject, perhaps asking about the university or local culture.
2. Inquire further about the attack on Moritz Schlick, hoping to learn more about the circumstances and any potential connection to the political climate.
3. Advise the students to consider leaving Vienna, as the situation appears to be deteriorating rapidly.
4. Thank the students for their time and continue on your way, deciding to explore the university grounds on your own.

[GM] You thank the students for their time and continue on your way, deciding to explore the university grounds on your own. As you make your way through the bustling courtyard, you can't help but feel a sense of unease in the air.

The once-vibrant atmosphere has been replaced by a palpable tension, with people moving quickly and keeping their heads down. You notice a group of men in dark suits and hats standing near the entrance, their eyes scanning the crowd with an unsettling intensity.

Deciding to steer clear of them, you make your way towards the main building, its grand, neo-Renaissance facade a stark contrast to the uneasy mood that permeates the campus. As you approach the entrance, you can't help but wonder what other secrets and tensions might be lurking beneath the surface of this historic institution.

1. Enter the university and make your way to the administrative offices, hoping to inquire about Moritz Schlick and the recent attack on him.
2. Observe the group of men in dark suits, trying to determine if they are Gestapo agents and whether they might be a threat.
3. Retrace your steps and exit the university grounds, deciding to explore the city of Vienna instead and gain a broader perspective on the political situation.
4. Approach a passing student or professor and engage them in casual conversation, hoping to learn more about the atmosphere on campus and any recent developments.

[GM] You decide to enter the university and make your way to the administrative offices, hoping to inquire about Moritz Schlick and the recent attack on him.

The grand marble foyer of the main building is a study in contrasts - the opulent, neo-Renaissance architecture stands in stark juxtaposition to the tense, hushed atmosphere that permeates the space. A group of students huddled in the corner cast furtive glances around the room, while a pair of professors stride purposefully down the hallway, their brows furrowed in concern.

You approach the front desk, where a middle-aged woman in a crisp, gray dress sits typing away at a typewriter. "Excuse me," you say, trying to keep your voice steady. "I was wondering if you could tell me anything about Professor Moritz Schlick and the recent incident involving him."

The woman pauses, her fingers hovering over the keys. She glances around the room nervously before leaning in and speaking in a hushed tone. "I'm afraid I can't discuss the details," she says, her eyes darting about. "But I would advise you to be careful in your inquiries. These are... delicate times."

1. Press the woman for more information, insisting that you have a right to know what happened to Schlick.
2. Thank the woman for her time and excuse yourself, deciding to explore the university library in search of more information.
3. Apologize for the intrusion and ask the woman if there is anyone else you could speak to about the matter, such as a dean or department head.
4. Heed the woman's warning and decide to leave the university grounds, opting to gather information from other sources in the city.

[GM] Heeding the woman's warning, you decide to leave the university grounds and seek out information from other sources in the city. As you step back out into the courtyard, the sense of unease only seems to have intensified.

The group of men in dark suits you noticed earlier are still standing near the entrance, their eyes scanning the crowd with an unsettling vigilance. You quicken your pace, wanting to put as much distance between yourself and them as possible.

Once you've cleared the university gates, you find yourself on a bustling street lined with shops and cafes. The air is thick with the aroma of freshly baked pastries and the chatter of the locals, but even here, you can't shake the feeling that something is amiss.

You pause for a moment, unsure of your next move. The city seems to be holding its breath, as if waiting for some unknown event to unfold.

1. Seek out a local cafe or pub, hoping to overhear conversations that might provide more insight into the political climate and the situation surrounding Moritz Schlick.
2. Head to a nearby newspaper stand and scan the headlines, looking for any clues about recent developments or potential unrest in the city.
3. Attempt to find the local police station or a government office, and inquire about the recent attack on Schlick, hoping to get a more official perspective on the matter.
4. Retrace your steps and return to the university, deciding that you need to gather more information from the source, despite the apparent risks.
[Player] 2
[GM] You decide to head to a nearby newspaper stand, hoping to glean some information about recent events in Vienna from the headlines. As you approach the stand, the vendor, an elderly man with a weathered face, eyes you warily.

"Newspaper, sir?" he asks, his voice gruff and suspicious.

You nod, scanning the various publications on display. The front pages are dominated by stories about the Anschluss and the growing influence of the Nazi regime in Austria. One headline in particular catches your eye: "Prominent Philosopher Moritz Schlick Attacked in Brazen Assault."

You quickly purchase a copy of the newspaper and begin to read the article, your eyes widening with each passing sentence. According to the report, Schlick was ambushed and shot while walking on the university campus just a few days ago. The assailant, a young man with ties to the Nazi party, is currently in custody, but the motive for the attack remains unclear.

As you finish reading, you glance up to find the vendor watching you intently, a mix of curiosity and concern etched on his weathered features.

1. Engage the vendor in conversation, asking for his thoughts on the attack and the broader political situation in Vienna.
2. Thank the vendor for the newspaper and continue on your way, deciding to find a quiet spot to study the article in more detail.
3. Inquire with the vendor about any other recent news or rumors circulating in the city, hoping to uncover additional clues about the attack on Schlick.
4. Fold the newspaper and tuck it into your coat, deciding to return to the university and see if you can gather more information from the administration or students.

[GM] You thank the vendor for the newspaper and continue on your way, deciding to find a quiet spot to study the article in more detail. As you walk, you can't help but feel a growing sense of unease. The bustling streets and charming cafes of Vienna seem to be tinged with an underlying tension, as if the city itself is holding its breath, waiting for some unseen storm to break.

You eventually find a small, tucked-away cafe and settle into a corner table, your eyes scanning the article once more. The details of the attack on Moritz Schlick are chilling - the renowned philosopher ambushed and shot by a young man with ties to the Nazi party. The motive, according to the report, remains unclear, but the implications are deeply troubling.

As you pore over the article, sipping a strong Viennese coffee, you can't help but wonder about the broader political context. The Anschluss, the crackdown on dissidents, the palpable sense of fear and unease that seems to permeate every corner of the city - all of it points to a society on the brink of something dark and foreboding.

1. Approach a nearby patron and strike up a conversation, discreetly inquiring about their thoughts on the attack and the political climate in Vienna.
2. Finish your coffee and exit the cafe, deciding to make your way back to the university and see if you can gather more information from the administration or students.
3. Fold the newspaper and tuck it back into your coat, deciding to explore the city further and see if you can uncover any additional clues about the attack on Schlick and its potential connection to the broader political situation.
4. Leave the cafe and head straight for the local police station, determined to speak with the authorities and see if they can provide any insight into the attack and its potential implications.
[Player] 4
[GM] Resolved to get to the bottom of the attack on Moritz Schlick, you leave the cafe and head straight for the local police station. The imposing, neoclassical building stands as a symbol of authority in the heart of the city, its stern facade a stark contrast to the unease that seems to permeate the streets.

As you approach the entrance, you can't help but feel a sense of trepidation. The Gestapo's growing presence in Vienna has cast a long shadow over the city, and you can't help but wonder how much the police force has been compromised by the Nazi regime.

Nonetheless, you steel your nerves and push open the heavy wooden doors, stepping into the dimly lit lobby. The air is thick with the scent of cigarette smoke and the sound of typewriters clacking away. A uniformed officer stands behind a counter, his eyes narrowing as you approach.

"How can I help you?" he asks, his voice gruff and suspicious.

1. Explain your concerns about the attack on Moritz Schlick and request to speak with someone who can provide more information about the investigation.
2. Tread carefully, acknowledging the officer's wariness and simply inquire about the process for filing a report or lodging a complaint.
3. Decide against engaging with the police, given the apparent political tensions, and instead exit the station, resolving to find another way to gather information.
4. Attempt to gauge the officer's political leanings and, if he seems sympathetic, share your concerns about the broader political situation in Vienna and the potential implications of the attack on Schlick.
[Player] 1
[GM] You explain your concerns about the attack on Moritz Schlick to the uniformed officer, emphasizing the need to understand the motives and potential implications of the assault. The officer listens intently, his expression unreadable, before gesturing for you to follow him.

He leads you to a small, cramped office, where a senior detective sits behind a cluttered desk. The detective listens to your account, his brow furrowing with concern. "This is a delicate matter," he says, his voice low and grave. "We're still investigating the attack, but it's clear the Nazis are tightening their grip on the city. Schlick's outspoken criticism of the regime may have made him a target."

The detective promises to keep you informed of any developments, but cautions that the political climate is growing increasingly volatile. As you leave the police station, you can't shake the feeling that the truth about Schlick's attack may be buried beneath layers of political intrigue and subterfuge. With a heavy heart, you resolve to continue your investigation, determined to uncover the reasons behind this troubling act of violence.
