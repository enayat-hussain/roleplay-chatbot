==============================

[GM] You materialize with a faint hum inside a cramped, glass-paned telephone booth. The air is thick with the scent of coal smoke and the distant clatter of horse-drawn carriages. Sunlight streams through the glass, illuminating dust motes dancing in the confined space. Outside, the imposing stone facade of the University of Vienna looms, its grand architecture a testament to a bygone era. It is June 15th, 1936, and Vienna feels like a city holding its breath.

What do you do?

1. Step out of the telephone booth and approach the university entrance.
2. Examine the contents of the telephone booth for any clues.
3. Look for a newspaper vendor nearby to get a sense of current events.
4. Try to make a phone call from the booth.
[Player] 2
[GM] You turn your attention to the interior of the telephone booth. The walls are a dull, scuffed green. A small, tarnished metal shelf holds a receiver and a dial. Tucked into a small metal holder beside the shelf is a worn, dog-eared telephone directory. A faint, almost imperceptible scent of old paper and something vaguely metallic lingers in the air.

What do you do?

1. Open and examine the telephone directory.
2. Inspect the receiver and dial more closely.
3. Look for any graffiti or hidden markings on the booth walls.
4. Step out of the telephone booth to observe your surroundings.
[Player] 2
[GM] You pick up the heavy, black bakelite receiver. It feels cold and solid in your hand. As you examine the dial, your fingers brush against a small, almost invisible scratch near the number '3'. It looks like it was made by a fingernail. There are no other obvious markings or anomalies on the phone itself.

What do you do?

1. Try to decipher the meaning of the scratch near the '3'.
2. Put the receiver back and open the telephone directory.
3. Look out of the booth to see if anyone is watching you.
4. Leave the telephone booth and head towards the university.
[Player] 2
[GM] You carefully place the receiver back on its cradle. The worn telephone directory is your next focus. Its pages are brittle and yellowed with age, filled with names and numbers in a neat, old-fashioned script. You flip through it, noting the alphabetical listings of Viennese residents and businesses, a snapshot of the city's communication network from this era. There are no loose pages or hidden compartments that you can immediately discern.

What do you do?

1. Search the directory for the name "Moritz Schlick."
2. Look for listings related to the University of Vienna.
3. Examine the directory's cover and binding for any unusual features.
4. Close the directory and step out of the telephone booth.
[Player] 3
[GM] You run your fingers along the faded blue cover of the telephone directory. The binding is slightly frayed, but otherwise unremarkable. As you examine the spine, you notice a small, almost imperceptible indentation, as if something was once pressed firmly against it. It's too small to be a clue in itself, but it sparks a thought. Perhaps something was hidden here, or perhaps this was simply an artifact of its frequent use. The directory, like the booth, offers no direct answers, only the quiet hum of history. Your journey to understand Moritz Schlick's fate has just begun, and the bustling streets of 1936 Vienna await your exploration.
