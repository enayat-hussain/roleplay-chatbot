==============================

[GM] The wooden door of the telephone booth creaks as you step out onto the Ringstraße, the air thick with the smell of horse manure and early summer dust. To your left, the massive Neo-Renaissance facade of the University of Vienna looms, its stone steps crowded with students in suits and traditional fraternities' caps. Newsstands nearby display headlines about Chancellor Schuschnigg’s recent diplomatic maneuvers and the continued suppression of both National Socialist and Social Democratic activities. Police officers in distinctive shako hats patrol the sidewalk, eyeing groups of young men with visible suspicion. It is June 15, 1936, a Monday morning, and the city hums with the uneasy energy of the Austrofascist "Ständestaat."

1. Approach a group of students near the main entrance to gauge the current political mood.
2. Buy a newspaper from a nearby kiosk to read about the latest government decrees.
3. Enter the University building to locate the office of the philosopher Moritz Schlick.
4. Walk toward the nearby Café Landtmann to observe the local intelligentsia and listen for rumors.

[GM] The cool, vaulted halls of the University echo with the sound of footsteps, the air smelling of old paper and floor wax. Near the grand staircase, a portrait of the assassinated Chancellor Dollfuß hangs prominently, a reminder of the regime's grip on academic life. You encounter a university porter in a stiff uniform who eyes your modern-looking shoes with a frown. "Professor Schlick's office is on the second floor, room 24, but he often holds court in the seminar rooms this time of day," the porter says, his voice echoing in the marble corridor. He leans in closer and mutters, "If you're one of those 'Circle' people, keep your voice down; the German-Nationalist students are in a foul mood today."

1. Ask the porter why the German-Nationalist students are particularly angry.
2. Head to the second floor to find Schlick’s office and see if it is unlocked.
3. Search for the seminar room to see if a lecture is currently in progress.
4. Check the university notice board for any official decrees or student manifestos.

[GM] You ascend the wide marble staircase to the second floor, passing stone busts of scholars that seem to watch your every move. Room 24 is located in a quiet corridor, its heavy dark wood door marked with a simple brass plate reading "Prof. Dr. Moritz Schlick." The door is locked, but a young man with disheveled hair and a stack of papers soon approaches, looking visibly anxious. "The Professor isn't here; he's dealing with more 'administrative difficulties' regarding his students' dissertations," the man says, glancing over his shoulder. He adds in a hushed tone, "The Ministry is tightening the screws on any philosophy they deem 'subversive' or 'un-German' these days."

1. Ask the man if he knows a student named Johann Nelböck.
2. Inquire about which specific ideas the Ministry finds "subversive."
3. Ask where the Professor is currently located so you can meet him.
4. Search the nearby corridor for any discarded documents or political flyers.

[GM] The young man leans against the cold stone wall, his eyes darting toward a group of students wearing the colors of a German-Nationalist fraternity. "They hate his 'Logical Positivism' because it leaves no room for their mystical 'Volksgeist' or the Church's dogma," he whispers intensely. "To the Ministry and the radicals, anything that relies on pure logic instead of 'blood and soil' is branded as 'Jewish-Bolshevik' poison, even though the Professor is of old German nobility. They want a philosophy that justifies the state, not one that analyzes the truth of language." He adjusts his grip on his papers, his knuckles white.

1. Ask if Schlick has received any specific threats from students or faculty recently.
2. Inquire about who the most vocal critics of Schlick are within the University's faculty.
3. Ask the young man for his name and what his specific role is under Professor Schlick.
4. Leave the corridor and head to the university library to look for published attacks against the Vienna Circle.
