==============================

[GM] You emerge from the telephone booth, the metal door creaking slightly as you step into the bustling streets of Vienna. The air is thick with the scents of smoke from nearby cafés and the faint perfume of blooming flowers from the gardens lining the university grounds. The University of Vienna stands majestically before you, its neo-Gothic architecture casting long shadows in the late morning sun. Students and professors meander through the courtyard, engaged in fervent discussions about philosophy, politics, and the troubling rise of fascism. Posters flapping in the breeze urge citizens to support the Austrian government, while others hint at the growing discontent among intellectuals.

1. Approach a group of students discussing political matters and ask them about the current political climate.
2. Enter the university building and seek out the philosophy department to find Moritz Schlick.
3. Visit a nearby café to gather information from locals about recent events in Vienna.
4. Explore the university grounds to observe any suspicious activity or individuals.

[GM] You decide to explore the university grounds, walking through the cobbled paths that wind between manicured gardens and old stone walls. The sounds of laughter and debate echo around you, but there’s an undercurrent of tension that prickles at your senses. As you stroll, you notice a small group of students gathered near a statue of the philosopher Franz Brentano, their voices hushed but animated. 

Suddenly, a sharp argument erupts between two men, one of whom is wearing a brown shirt emblazoned with the emblem of the Austrian Nazi Party. His opponent, clearly agitated, defends the values of democracy and freedom of thought. You can feel the palpable anger in the air, and a few curious onlookers begin to gather. The weight of the political climate is heavy here; you sense that dissent is brewing beneath the surface.

1. Approach the arguing men and inquire about their disagreement.
2. Observe the group from a distance to gather more context before intervening.
3. Seek out a nearby faculty member to discuss the growing tensions in the university.
4. Leave the university grounds to find a local newspaper to gather more information about current events.

[GM] You step forward, interrupting the heated exchange between the two men. The brown-shirted individual glares at you, but the other, a tall student with dark hair and fiery eyes, welcomes your inquiry. "We're discussing the future of our country," he states passionately, gesturing animatedly. "These fascists want to silence any dissenting voices and impose their twisted ideology on us! We must defend our right to think freely!" 

The brown-shirt scoffs, crossing his arms defiantly. "You think this is about freedom? The so-called intellectuals are leading Austria to ruin! We need strength, not weakness." The tension is palpable, and you can sense that this disagreement is more than just a simple argument; it’s reflective of the broader conflict tearing through Austria.

1. Side with the student advocating for freedom and ask him how you can support his cause.
2. Challenge the brown-shirt on his views and ask how he justifies his beliefs.
3. Suggest that they both calm down and discuss their points more rationally.
4. Ask them if they’ve heard anything about Moritz Schlick's recent activities or opinions.

[GM] You direct your question toward the group, hoping to glean insights about Moritz Schlick. The tall student’s expression shifts from anger to curiosity. “Schlick? He’s one of the few who stands against the tide of totalitarianism,” he replies, his voice dropping slightly as if cautious of being overheard. “He’s been a beacon of rational thought, advocating for logical positivism, but his ideas are increasingly under threat. Just the other day, I overheard some men discussing him quite viciously.”

The brown-shirt shifts uncomfortably, glancing around as if worried about being associated with the discussion. “He’s a traitor to our nation’s values,” he mutters, but the student brushes him off, focusing back on you. “If you’re looking for him, he’s often in the philosophy building. But be careful; there are those who want to silence him.”

1. Thank the student for the information and head toward the philosophy building to find Schlick.
2. Ask the student what specifically they heard about the threats to Schlick.
3. Inquire about the brown-shirt’s accusations against Schlick to understand the other perspective.
4. Suggest forming a student group to protect Schlick and rally support for his ideas.
[Player] 4
[GM] You suggest forming a student group to protect Moritz Schlick and rally support for rational discourse and freedom of thought. The tall student’s eyes light up at the idea, and he quickly gathers the others, igniting a spark of hope among them. They begin to brainstorm ways to raise awareness, organizing meetings to discuss Schlick’s philosophy and the importance of safeguarding intellectual freedom in the face of rising fascism.

As the group gains momentum, whispers of their efforts reach the ears of professors and sympathetic students, creating a network of support. However, the tension in Vienna continues to rise, and you sense that the stakes are higher than ever. Just days later, you hear the tragic news of Moritz Schlick's murder, a devastating blow to the movement you helped inspire. The group vows to honor his legacy, determined to continue the fight for freedom of thought and expression, forever changed by the events that unfolded in those tense days of June 1936. 

As you prepare to return to your own time, you realize that the seeds of change have been planted, and the echoes of Schlick's ideas will resonate through time, inspiring future generations to stand against tyranny.
