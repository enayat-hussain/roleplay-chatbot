==============================

[GM] You step out of the telephone booth, a relic from a bygone era, and take a deep breath of the warm summer air. The year is 1936, and the city of Vienna is alive with the sounds of a bustling metropolis. The telephone booth, a bright red cube with a chrome door, stands out against the drab backdrop of the university's brick buildings. You've arrived in the midst of a new era, one marked by the rise of fascism and the decline of democracy.

As you look around, you notice the grand facade of the University of Vienna, its imposing stone structure a testament to the institution's rich history. The streets are filled with students, some of whom glance at you with curiosity, while others hurry to class, briefcases in hand. The sound of horse-drawn carriages and motorcars fills the air, a reminder of the city's rich cultural heritage.

You've been sent back in time to uncover the truth behind the murder of Moritz Schlick, a prominent philosopher who was brutally shot in his office just a few years from now. You have a narrow window of time to gather information and piece together the events that led to his tragic demise.

You stand outside the university, trying to get your bearings. You know that the philosophy department is located in the north wing of the main building. You also recall that Schlick was a prominent figure in the department, known for his work in the philosophy of science.

Here are your options:

1. **Enter the university through the main entrance**, hoping to blend in with the students and faculty, and make your way to the philosophy department.
2. **Visit the local newspaper office**, the Neue Freie Presse, to see if they have any information about Schlick or any other potential leads.
3. **Head to the nearby coffee shop**, where you might be able to gather information from students or faculty members who are more willing to talk.
4. **Take a stroll through the city**, getting a feel for the lay of the land and seeing if you can pick up any rumors or gossip about Schlick or the university.

[GM] You push open the heavy wooden doors and step into the grand foyer of the University of Vienna. The sound of footsteps echoes off the marble floor as you make your way to the information desk, where a bespectacled student is busy answering questions from a group of inquiring tourists. You approach the desk, trying to blend in with the crowd, and ask the student for directions to the philosophy department.

The student, whose name tag reads "Hans," looks you up and down before nodding curtly and pointing down a long corridor to your left. "Philosophy department is down that way, Herr...?" he trails off, expecting you to fill in your name.

You hesitate for a moment before responding, "Just a visitor, thank you." Hans nods and returns to his conversation with the tourists, who are asking him about the university's history.

You make your way down the corridor, taking in the sights and sounds of the bustling university. The walls are adorned with portraits of prominent philosophers and scientists, and the air is thick with the smell of old books and dust. You pass by several classrooms, where students are engaged in lively debates and discussions.

As you approach the philosophy department, you notice a group of students gathered outside the door, engaged in a heated conversation. They glance at you suspiciously as you approach, and one of them steps forward, blocking your path.

"Can we help you?" he asks gruffly, eyeing you with a mixture of curiosity and hostility.

You realize that you're not sure how to respond, and that you may have attracted unwanted attention.

Here are your options:

1. **Try to bluff your way past the student**, hoping to convincingly play the role of a visiting scholar.
2. **Ask the student if you can join their conversation**, trying to ingratiate yourself with the group.
3. **Politely decline and continue on your way**, hoping to avoid any further confrontation.
4. **Ask the student if he knows anything about Moritz Schlick**, hoping to strike up a conversation that might lead to useful information.

[GM] You smile and ask the student if you can join their conversation, hoping to ingratiate yourself with the group. The student eyes you warily, but after a moment, nods and steps aside. You join the group, listening intently as they discuss the latest developments in the philosophy of science. One of them mentions Moritz Schlick, and you seize the opportunity to ask a question. The student who spoke up earlier, whose name is Franz, looks at you with interest and begins to tell you about Schlick's work. As you listen, you realize that Franz is a member of the Nazi-affiliated student group, and that his admiration for Schlick is tinged with a hint of irony. You thank Franz for his time, and he nods, seeming to relax in your presence. You leave the philosophy department with a newfound understanding of the complex web of relationships and ideologies that surround Schlick. Your mission is complete, and you feel a sense of satisfaction at having uncovered a piece of history.

You return to your own time, reflecting on the events that transpired. The murder of Moritz Schlick was indeed a tragic event, but one that was ultimately tied to the broader currents of politics and ideology that swept through Europe in the 1930s. Your actions may have changed the course of events, but the outcome is ultimately uncertain.
