==============================

[GM] You step out of a wooden telephone booth onto the Ringstraße, the air thick with the smell of coal smoke and horse manure. To your left, the monumental facade of the University of Vienna looms, a center of intellectual life currently under the strict control of the Austrofascist "Ständestaat" regime. Pedestrians in fedoras and long coats hurry past, many avoiding eye contact with a group of Fatherland Front militia members patrolling the sidewalk. A nearby newspaper kiosk displays headlines about Chancellor Schuschnigg's efforts to maintain Austrian independence amidst increasing pressure from Nazi Germany. Your mission begins here, one week before the scheduled death of Professor Moritz Schlick.

1. Approach the newspaper kiosk to read the latest political news and see if Schlick's name appears in the press.
2. Walk toward the University’s main entrance to find a lecture schedule or a departmental directory.
3. Sit at a nearby café to observe the students and faculty and listen for local rumors.
4. Strike up a conversation with the Fatherland Front militia members to gauge the current security climate around the University.

[GM] The militia members stand rigidly in their dark uniforms, the *Kruckenkreuz* armbands clearly visible on their sleeves. One corporal steps forward, his expression hardening as he eyes your unfamiliar clothing with deep suspicion. "Identify yourself; we are on high alert for illegal Nazi demonstrators and Bolshevik provocateurs," he barks, his hand resting near his holster. He gestures toward the university entrance, noting that security has been tightened by order of the Schuschnigg government to prevent further campus brawls. The air is thick with the tension of a regime struggling to maintain a fragile Austrian independence against both internal and external threats.

1. Produce forged identification papers and ask about recent "disturbances" on campus.
2. Apologize for the intrusion and ask if they have seen Professor Moritz Schlick arrive for his lectures.
3. Ask their opinion on the "Jewish and Masonic influence" at the university to see if they share the radical students' grievances.
4. Quickly excuse yourself and walk away toward the university library to avoid further questioning.

[GM] The corporal takes your papers, squinting at the stamps and the emblem of the Fatherland Front with a critical eye. "Everything seems in order, though you look like you've come from far away," he grunts, handing them back with a stiff nod. He leans in closer, his voice dropping to a low, gravelly rasp: "The university is a powder keg; those illegal Nazi students are getting bolder, shouting slogans in the halls and harassing any professor they deem 'un-German' or too liberal." He gestures toward the heavy stone arches of the entrance, noting that the police have been called three times this week to quell brawls between rival student factions. A group of students in traditional *Burschenschaft* caps marches past, their faces set in grim, nationalist defiance.

1. Follow the nationalist students to see if they are planning a demonstration or a confrontation.
2. Ask the corporal if specific professors, like Moritz Schlick, are currently under police protection.
3. Enter the university and head toward the Philosophy Department to find Schlick’s office.
4. Go to the newspaper kiosk to see how the state-controlled press is framing these campus "disturbances."

[GM] The students gather in a corner of the university courtyard, their colored caps and sashes marking them as members of a nationalist fraternity. One youth with a dueling scar on his cheek gestures toward the Philosophy Department and sneers, "The spirit of the German people will not be stifled by these logic-choppers and their Jewish-liberal lies." He pulls a pamphlet from his coat titled *The Case of Schlick*, which characterizes the professor as a threat to traditional Austrian values and a proponent of "soul-destroying" positivism. His companions nod fervently, one of them adding, "Soon, the university will be cleansed of these internationalist elements once and for all." The atmosphere is thick with ideological hatred, reflecting the deep polarization of a city caught between Austrofascism and the rising tide of National Socialism.

1. Ask the student with the dueling scar where one can get a copy of the pamphlet.
2. Wait for the group to disperse and follow the student who seemed most agitated.
3. Quietly pick up a discarded pamphlet from the ground to read its contents more closely.
4. Leave the courtyard and head directly to the Philosophy Department to see if Schlick is aware of this hostility.
