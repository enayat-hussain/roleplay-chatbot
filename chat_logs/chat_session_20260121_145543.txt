[GM] You materialize in a telephone booth just outside the grand entrance of the University of Vienna. The air is filled with a mix of anticipation and tension as students bustle about, their voices blending into a cacophony of youthful enthusiasm and the weight of somber discussions. The university itself stands as a proud monument of knowledge and culture, its neoclassical architecture adorned with intricate statues and reliefs that echo centuries of scholarship. However, a palpable undercurrent of political unease permeates the atmosphere, as the rise of nationalist sentiments and anti-Semitic rhetoric grow louder in Austrian society. 

As you step out of the booth, you notice posters plastered on nearby walls, some promoting student rallies, others bearing ominous warnings about the Socialist movement. The sun casts a warm light, yet the shadows of potential conflict loom larger.

You consider your next move. What will you do?

[GM] You decide to find a nearby café, hoping to overhear conversations and gather insights from locals. After a short walk, you arrive at "Café Central," a beloved gathering place for intellectuals and students alike. The interior is warm and inviting, with dark wood paneling and marble-topped tables, where patrons sip coffee and engage in animated discussions. The clinking of cups and the rustle of newspapers fill the air as the scent of freshly baked pastries wafts from the kitchen.

You take a seat at a corner table, and soon, you overhear two men in heated discussion. One is a university professor, his brow furrowed with concern, while the other, a younger man, speaks passionately about the growing influence of the Nazis in Austria. You catch snippets of their conversation about the increasing pressure on intellectuals and the dangers faced by those who oppose the regime. 

The professor, noticing your interest, glances over and offers a wary smile. “It’s a troubling time,” he admits softly. “We stand at a crossroads, and the future is uncertain.”

You ponder your next move. What will you do?

1. Engage the professor in conversation about the political climate and Moritz Schlick.
2. Eavesdrop on the younger man's conversation with another patron.

[GM] Deciding that you need more direct information about Moritz Schlick, you leave the warm ambiance of Café Central and step back onto the bustling streets of Vienna. The sun is now beginning its descent, casting long shadows as the vibrant city transitions from day to night. You navigate through the narrow cobblestone streets, where the architecture is a stunning blend of Gothic and Baroque styles, each building telling its own story.

You make your way back to the University of Vienna, heart racing with anticipation. As you approach the university’s entrance, you notice a small group of students gathering around a bulletin board plastered with flyers and announcements. The atmosphere is charged with energy as they discuss the upcoming student protests against rising fascist sentiments. 

One of the students catches your eye and gestures for you to join them. “You look like you might care about what’s happening here,” she says earnestly. “Have you heard about the debates surrounding Schlick? His ideas are becoming increasingly dangerous to some.”

You feel a flicker of hope at the prospect of learning more about Schlick's situation. What will you do next?

[GM] You step forward, your curiosity piqued, and ask the students if they know where Moritz Schlick might be found at this time. The group pauses their animated discussion, and a tall student with glasses nods thoughtfully. “He usually holds his lectures in the main auditorium, but today he’s been seen in his office preparing for a presentation. You might catch him there if you hurry.”

Another student, a young woman with fiery red hair, adds, “Just be careful. There are some people who don’t agree with his views, and tensions are running high. You never know who might be watching.”

Feeling a sense of urgency, you thank them and make your way toward Schlick’s office, navigating through the grand hallways adorned with portraits of past scholars. As you approach his office door, you notice the faint sound of voices inside, discussing philosophical concepts. 

You take a moment to gather your thoughts, contemplating how to approach him. What will you do next?

2. Listen at the door to gather more information before entering.

[Player] 4
[GM] You decide to look for another faculty member nearby, hoping to gather insights about Moritz Schlick’s current situation. As you step back from Schlick’s office door, you scan the bustling hallways filled with students and professors, all engaged in their academic pursuits. The walls are lined with framed degrees and accolades, showcasing the university's rich history.

You spot an older gentleman with a distinguished air, his gray hair neatly combed back, conversing with a group of students. He appears to be a professor, likely someone who has been at the university for many years. You approach him cautiously, and as he notices you, his expression turns from curiosity to concern.

“Can I help you, young lady?” he asks, his voice steady yet wary. You take a breath and explain that you are looking to learn more about Moritz Schlick and the current political climate affecting his work. 

The professor’s brow furrows, and he glances around to ensure no one is listening. “Schlick is a brilliant mind, but he’s treaded on dangerous ground lately. The rise of the Nazis has made his rationalist views a target for many who oppose liberal thinking. Be careful; his safety may be more fragile than you realize.”

You feel the weight of his words and consider your next move. What will you do next?

2. Inquire about the specific threats Schlick has faced recently.
3. Ask the professor if he has any advice on how to speak with Schlick.

[Player] 4
[GM] Resolute in your quest for answers, you decide to leave the conversation and head directly to Moritz Schlick's office. As you navigate the corridors of the University of Vienna, the echoes of footsteps resonate against the marble floor, and the scent of old books and polished wood fills the air. You reach Schlick’s door once again, the faint murmur of voices inside now more distinct, revealing the philosophical discussions that are part of his daily routine.

With a steady hand, you knock lightly on the door. After a brief pause, the door swings open, revealing Moritz Schlick himself. He’s a middle-aged man with sharp features and an intensity in his gaze that reflects his intellectual prowess. He looks surprised to see you, yet there’s a flicker of warmth in his eyes. “Yes? Can I help you?” he asks, his tone inviting yet cautious.

Before you can respond, you notice a flicker of concern cross his face, as if he senses the weight of the political climate pressing in on him. You gather your thoughts, ready to engage with this brilliant mind who may hold the key to understanding the dangers he faces.

What will you do next?

1. Introduce yourself and ask Schlick about his thoughts on the current political situation.
2. Inquire directly about the threats he has received due to his philosophical beliefs.
3. Ask if he would be willing to share his views on why he believes rationalism is under attack.
4. Suggest a safe place to discuss his ideas away from potential eavesdroppers.
[Player] 2
[GM] You take a deep breath and ask Schlick directly about the threats he has received due to his philosophical beliefs. His expression shifts from surprise to a somber seriousness, and he steps aside to invite you into his office, closing the door behind you. The room is filled with bookshelves brimming with texts on logic, philosophy, and science; a large wooden desk is scattered with papers and inkpots, illustrating a mind constantly at work.

“It's a precarious time for thinkers like me,” Schlick replies, his voice low and intense. “The rise of fascism in Austria and Germany has fostered an environment hostile to rationalist thought. I've received letters threatening to silence me, and some have openly called for my dismissal from the university. The atmosphere is thick with fear.” He gestures to a stack of letters on his desk, some of which bear official-looking seals.

As he speaks, you can sense the weight of his words. He is not merely a scholar; he is a target, caught in the crossfire of a growing ideological battle. 

You feel compelled to delve deeper into this dangerous situation. What will you do next?

1. Ask Schlick if he has considered leaving Vienna for his safety.
2. Inquire about the specific individuals or groups behind the threats he mentioned.
3. Suggest forming a group of like-minded individuals to support each other.
4. Offer to help him in any way you can, whether it's through information or protection.
[Player] 4
[GM] You express your willingness to help Schlick in any way you can, whether through information or protection. His eyes widen slightly, a mix of surprise and gratitude flickering across his features. “You are kind to offer, but this is a dangerous game we are playing,” he says, his voice steady yet laced with apprehension. “I’m not sure what help you can provide, but the thought of having an ally is reassuring.”

He leans back in his chair, contemplating your offer. “Many of my colleagues are hesitant to speak out, fearing repercussions. If you have connections or knowledge of the political landscape, that could be valuable. However, I must warn you, the situation is volatile. Those who oppose the regime have been disappearing.”

As he speaks, you feel the weight of responsibility settle upon your shoulders. You realize that your presence here is not merely a quest for knowledge; it may also be a matter of life and death for Schlick and others like him.

You contemplate your next move carefully. What will you do next?

1. Share what you know about the political climate and suggest ways to navigate it safely.
2. Ask Schlick for more details about who might be targeting him and why.
3. Propose arranging a secret meeting with other scholars who share his views.
4. Encourage Schlick to consider leaving Vienna for a safer location.
[Player] 3
[GM] You propose arranging a secret meeting with other scholars who share Schlick's views, hoping to create a network of support and solidarity. His eyes light up at the suggestion, and a sense of hope flickers in his expression. “That could be a wise move,” he replies, leaning forward in his chair. “There are a few trusted colleagues who still believe in rational discourse and freedom of thought. If we could gather them discreetly, we could discuss our concerns and formulate a plan.”

He begins to jot down names on a piece of paper, his pen moving swiftly across the page. “We must be careful, though. The walls have ears, and we cannot afford to be reckless. Perhaps we could meet in a café that is less frequented by students and political radicals.”

As he finishes writing, you feel a surge of purpose; this might be a crucial step toward not only protecting Schlick but also defending the ideals he stands for. The shadows in the room seem to deepen as the stakes rise, and you realize that the meeting could have significant consequences for all involved.

You consider your next steps carefully. What will you do next?

1. Suggest a specific café where the meeting could take place and arrange the details.
2. Ask Schlick if he has any concerns about potential dangers at such a meeting.
3. Offer to help recruit additional scholars who might be willing to join the cause.
4. Propose a backup plan in case the meeting is discovered or interrupted.
[Player] 4
[GM] You propose a backup plan in case the meeting is discovered or interrupted, knowing that the stakes are high and the potential for danger is ever-present. Schlick nods thoughtfully, the lines of worry deepening on his forehead. “You’re right; we must be prepared for unforeseen circumstances,” he agrees, his voice tinged with urgency. “If we are discovered, it could lead to arrests, or worse.”

He pauses and then outlines a couple of contingency strategies. “If the meeting is interrupted, we should have a signal in place. If someone appears suspicious, we can disperse quickly. I also suggest we use a secondary location—an old bookshop near the university that I know well. It has hidden corners where we can easily blend in.”

Schlick's eyes meet yours, and you can see the determination in his gaze. “In addition, we should establish a means to communicate without drawing attention. Perhaps a code we can use in our correspondence to indicate urgency.” 

Feeling the weight of the plan take form, you ponder the next steps in ensuring the meeting goes off without a hitch. What will you do next?

1. Suggest a specific time and date for the meeting in the bookshop.
2. Propose a code for communication and discuss how it will work.
3. Ask Schlick about the potential risks involved with the chosen backup location.
4. Offer to scout the bookshop to assess its safety and suitability for the meeting.
[Player] 4
[GM] You offer to scout the bookshop to assess its safety and suitability for the meeting. Schlick nods appreciatively, understanding the importance of ensuring a secure environment. After leaving his office, you navigate the winding streets of Vienna until you reach the quaint bookshop, its façade weathered but charming. Inside, the scent of aged paper and leather fills the air, and the dim light casts a cozy glow over the shelves.

You discreetly observe the layout, noting the secluded corners and the back entrance that could serve as an escape route. Satisfied with your findings, you return to Schlick, sharing your insights and confirming the bookshop as a viable meeting spot. 

As the day of the gathering approaches, a sense of camaraderie builds among the scholars who join you. Though the political climate remains perilous, the meeting fosters a renewed sense of hope and determination among those who cherish rational discourse. You realize that your presence in this time is not just about uncovering the past but about protecting the future of thought itself.
