==============================

[GM] The air is crisp and carries a faint hint of impending summer warmth as you step out of the telephone booth, a relic of modernity in the historic heart of Vienna. The University of Vienna looms before you, its grand architecture a testament to centuries of academic brilliance. Students and professors alike bustle about, their conversations a mix of philosophical debate and political discourse, reflecting the tense atmosphere of the time. The year is 1936, and the rise of fascism in Europe casts a long shadow over the intellectual community, with many fearing the implications of their ideas being suppressed.

As you take in your surroundings, you notice a group of students animatedly discussing the latest developments in the political landscape, with a particular focus on the growing influence of the Nazi regime in neighboring Germany. Nearby, a small newsstand displays the latest headlines, some of which hint at unrest in the streets and the growing divide between liberal and conservative factions in Austria.

You sense that your mission to uncover the reasons behind Moritz Schlick's murder is about to begin. What will you do next?

1. Approach the group of students and join their discussion about the political situation in Austria.
2. Visit the newsstand to read the latest headlines and gather information on current events.
3. Enter the University of Vienna and try to find Moritz Schlick's office or classroom.

[GM] You decide to take a moment to survey your surroundings, your instinct guiding you to look for anything out of the ordinary. As you scan the area, you notice a tall man with a dark overcoat leaning against a lamppost, his eyes darting around as if searching for someone. His anxious demeanor contrasts sharply with the otherwise bustling environment. You also spot a group of older men, their crisp suits and somber expressions suggesting they belong to a more conservative faction, engaged in a hushed conversation not far from the university entrance.

Amidst the students, a woman stands alone, clutching a bundle of papers, her brow furrowed in concern as she glances towards the lamppost where the tall man stands. The atmosphere feels charged, as if a storm is brewing just beneath the surface. You can't shake the feeling that something significant is about to happen.

What will you do next?

1. Approach the tall man by the lamppost and inquire about whom he is waiting for.
2. Intercept the group of older men and ask them about the political climate in Vienna.
3. Speak to the woman with the papers and find out what troubles her.
4. Continue observing from a distance, hoping to catch more details of their conversation.

[GM] You stride confidently towards the group of older men, their serious expressions hinting at deep concerns. As you approach, they pause their conversation, sizing you up with interest. One of them, a distinguished gentleman with silver hair and a monocle, steps forward. "What brings you here, young lady? This is not a time for idle chatter," he remarks, his tone both curious and slightly dismissive.

You decide to press on, asking them about the political climate in Vienna. The man’s demeanor shifts; he leans in closer, lowering his voice. "We are on the brink," he says gravely. "The influence of the Nazis grows stronger by the day. There's talk of unrest, and many of us fear what this could mean for our freedoms and our lives." The others nod solemnly, their eyes reflecting a mix of fear and determination.

As the conversation unfolds, you sense that these men are not merely casual observers but rather active participants in the struggle against the encroaching tide of fascism. Their insights may hold valuable clues to understanding the environment surrounding Moritz Schlick.

What will you do next?

1. Ask the men if they have heard any rumors about Moritz Schlick or his recent activities.
2. Inquire about their plans to counter the growing influence of the Nazis in Austria.

[GM] You lean in closer, intrigued by the gravity of their discussion, and ask the men about their plans to counter the growing influence of the Nazis in Austria. The distinguished gentleman with the monocle exchanges glances with his companions, and then he straightens his posture, eager to share their resolve. "We are forming a coalition of like-minded intellectuals and activists who understand the importance of defending our democratic ideals," he explains, his voice laced with urgency. "But we are met with opposition at every turn, both from within the government and from radical factions."

One of the other men, a stout fellow with a thick mustache, interjects, "We need more voices to join us, but the fear of retribution is palpable. Many are reluctant to speak out, and those who do often find themselves ostracized." The group collectively exhales, the weight of their predicament hanging heavily in the air. You realize that Moritz Schlick, a prominent figure in the Vienna Circle, may be integral to their efforts and could be in danger due to his outspoken views.

What will you do next?

1. Press them for details on how they plan to mobilize support for their cause.
2. Ask if they know of anyone who has faced repercussions for opposing the Nazis.
3. Offer to help them in their efforts, sharing your own background as a time traveler.
4. Excuse yourself from the conversation and head to the university to find Moritz Schlick.

[GM] You press the men for details on how they plan to mobilize support for their cause, and the distinguished gentleman leans in, his eyes glinting with a newfound hope. "We aim to hold a public forum next week, inviting anyone who values reason and democracy to join us. It is imperative that we rally the youth, the intellectuals, and the citizens who still believe in a free Austria." He glances at his companions, who nod in agreement, a flicker of determination igniting among them.

As you prepare to leave, you realize that Moritz Schlick must be informed of these developments; his voice could be the catalyst for change. The urgency of the situation weighs heavily on you, and with a final nod of encouragement from the men, you make your way to the university. There, you find Schlick engaged in a discussion with students, his passion for philosophy undiminished by the political turmoil around him. You know that your mission is not only to understand his fate but to ensure that his voice—and those like him—are not silenced in the days to come.
