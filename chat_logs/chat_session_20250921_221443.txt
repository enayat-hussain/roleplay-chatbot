==============================

[GM] You find yourself standing outside a vintage telephone booth on the University of Vienna's campus, the sounds of bustling students and chirping birds filling the air. The warm June sun casts long shadows across the cobblestone streets as you gaze out at the majestic buildings that seem frozen in time. You take a deep breath, feeling the familiar scent of old books and coffee wafting through the air.

It's 15th June 1936, and Austria is on the brink of a great change. The country is still reeling from the Anschluss with Nazi Germany just a year ago, and tensions are running high. As you step out of the booth, the university's imposing main building looms before you, its ornate clock tower striking the hour in the distance.

You've been sent back in time to investigate the murder of Moritz Schlick, a renowned philosopher and professor at this very university. Your mission is to uncover the events that led to his tragic demise. But where do you start?

Here are your options:

1. Head straight to the university's main building to gather information about Schlick's work and colleagues.
2. Visit the local café, Café Central, to hear rumors and gossip from students and faculty members.
3. Explore the surrounding streets to get a feel for the city's mood and politics.
4. Visit the nearby police station to inquire about any potential leads or witnesses related to Schlick's murder.

[GM] You decide to explore the surrounding streets, taking in the sights and sounds of Vienna's vibrant atmosphere. You wander past quaint shops and cafes, admiring the ornate architecture and bustling street performers. The smell of fresh bread wafts from a nearby bakery, enticing your senses.

As you turn a corner, you notice a group of students gathered around a makeshift soapbox, engaged in heated debate about politics and philosophy. One student, dressed in a worn jacket with a red armband, holds forth on the importance of socialist ideals. Another student, sporting a Hitler Youth uniform, counters with fervent enthusiasm for Nazi ideology.

You continue your stroll, passing by street vendors selling propaganda pamphlets and newspapers. The headlines scream about Chancellor Schuschnigg's attempts to resist Nazi pressure and the growing tensions in Europe. You can't help but feel the air thickening with anticipation as you walk.

As the sun begins to set, casting a golden glow over the city, you find yourself at the edge of the Innere Stadt district. The iconic St. Stephen's Cathedral rises majestically before you, its intricate stone carvings glinting in the fading light.

Here are your options:

1. Visit the nearby coffeehouse, Landtmann, to gather intel from local intellectuals and academics.
2. Head back to the university campus to investigate Schlick's office and research materials.
3. Stop by a local bookstore to browse through the shelves for any clues or information about Schlick's work.
4. Join the debate circle you saw earlier, blending in with the students and gathering insight into their views on politics and philosophy.

[GM] You duck into a cozy bookstore, the scent of old paper and leather binding filling your nostrils. The shelves are stacked with tomes on philosophy, history, and literature, each one bearing the subtle signs of wear and tear from generations of readers. You browse through the shelves, running your fingers over the spines of the books as you search for any connection to Moritz Schlick.

As you delve deeper into the store, you come across a section dedicated to Schlick's own works – his philosophical treatises on logic and epistemology, alongside translations of his lectures on existentialism. You pause in front of a shelf, running your eyes over the titles, when a bespectacled bookseller notices your interest.

"Ah, Professor Schlick's works, are they?" he says, his voice low and gravelly. "A fascinating man, indeed. His ideas on logical positivism have caused quite a stir among the intellectual circles."

He leans in closer, his eyes twinkling with curiosity. "I've heard rumors of some...unsettling discussions Schlick had with certain individuals around campus. Nothing concrete, just whispers and rumors. But I suppose it's possible that they might be relevant to your investigation?"

Here are your options:

1. Ask the bookseller if he knows anyone who might have been involved in these discussions or can provide more information.
2. Browse through the store some more, searching for any other clues or connections to Schlick's work.
3. Visit the university library to see if they have any records of Schlick's lectures or research materials that might be relevant to your investigation.
4. Head back to the telephone booth, feeling like you've struck a dead end, and try to decide what direction to take next.

[GM] You reluctantly leave the bookstore, feeling like you've reached a dead end in your investigation. As you step out onto the cobblestone streets, the sounds of Vienna's evening life swirl around you – the chatter of pedestrians, the clinking of glasses at outdoor cafes, and the distant hum of street performers.

You make your way back to the telephone booth, the familiar sight of it a comforting anchor in the midst of uncertainty. You take a deep breath, mentally replaying the events that have transpired since your arrival in 1936. The warm glow of the streetlamps seems to intensify as you stand there, weighing your next move.

As you ponder, a group of students hurries past the booth, their faces aglow with excitement and discussion. One of them catches your eye – a young woman with piercing green eyes and curly brown hair, her gaze lingering on yours for a fleeting moment before she's swept away by the tide of conversation.

You wonder if this chance encounter might hold some significance in your investigation. Here are your options:

1. Follow the group of students, trying to catch up with the young woman and learn more about their interests and connections.
2. Return to the university campus, hoping to find some new lead or clue hidden within the labyrinthine corridors.
3. Visit a local newspaper kiosk, scanning the headlines for any relevant news or rumors that might shed light on Schlick's murder.
4. Duck into a nearby café, ordering a cup of coffee and observing the patrons, searching for any subtle connections to your investigation.

[GM] You push open the door of a nearby newspaper kiosk, the sounds of Vienna's streets muffled by the sudden darkness within. The vendor, a gruff but kind-eyed man with a bushy mustache, looks up from behind his stack of newspapers.

"Waschbärenzeitung," he says, holding up a paper with a bold headline: "Schuschnigg's Plea for Aid Falls on Deaf Ears." "The Chancellor's speech to the Reichstag has sparked outrage among the Austrian people. It seems the country is torn apart by internal divisions and external pressures."

You scan the headlines, searching for any mention of Moritz Schlick or his murder. Your eyes widen as you spot a small article buried deep within the paper:

"Philosopher Professor Moritz Schlick Found Dead in His Office. Police Investigating Possible Connection to Recent Student Protests."

The vendor notices your interest and leans in closer. "It's been a chaotic few days, mein Herr. Rumors are flying about secret societies and conspiracies at the university. Some folks say it's all connected to Schlick's murder..."

He glances around nervously before continuing in a hushed tone: "I heard whispers of a mysterious figure seen lurking near Schlick's office on the night of his death. No one knows what to make of it, but I thought you might find it interesting."

Here are your options:

1. Visit the university police station to ask about the investigation into Schlick's murder and any leads they might have.
2. Head back to the telephone booth to regroup and reassess your next move.
3. Follow a lead on a local student protest group, hoping to uncover more information about their connection to Schlick's murder.
4. Visit the university's main building, searching for any clues or connections between Schlick's work and his murder.

[GM] You decide to follow a lead on a local student protest group, hoping to uncover more information about their connection to Schlick's murder. You track down the group to a secluded courtyard, where they're gathered around a makeshift soapbox, passionately discussing politics and philosophy.

As you listen in, you notice a familiar figure - the young woman with piercing green eyes from earlier. She catches your gaze, and you sense a spark of recognition. You approach her, and she introduces herself as Anna, a student activist deeply troubled by Schlick's murder.

Anna reveals that Schlick was planning to expose a secret society within the university, one tied to Nazi ideology. His murder was meant to silence him permanently. With this new information, you piece together the events leading up to his death.

As you stand there, the courtyard falls silent. The students disperse, and Anna approaches you with tears in her eyes. "Thank you for uncovering the truth," she whispers. "You've given us a chance to fight back against the forces of oppression."

With Schlick's murder solved, you feel a sense of closure. You realize that your mission was not just about solving a crime but also about empowering those who sought justice and freedom in the face of tyranny.

As you step out of the courtyard, the city's sounds return, and you know that this is only the beginning of a new chapter in Vienna's tumultuous history.
