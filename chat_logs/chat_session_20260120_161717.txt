==============================

[GM] You find yourself standing in a classic red telephone booth just outside the grand, neo-Renaissance style building of the University of Vienna. The ornate facade is adorned with statues and columns, a testament to the institution's long and storied history. The streets are bustling with activity - students hurry to and fro, professors in tweed jackets stride purposefully, and the occasional horse-drawn carriage clatters by.

The air is alive with the sounds of a vibrant city - the chatter of passersby, the honking of automobile horns, and the tolling of the church bells in the distance. The sun is high in the sky, casting a warm glow over the scene.

As you take in your surroundings, you feel a sense of both excitement and trepidation, knowing that you have been sent back in time to uncover the truth behind the murder of the prominent philosopher Moritz Schlick.

Your options are:

1. Approach a nearby student and inquire about the university and the city of Vienna.
2. Head inside the university building and try to find information about Moritz Schlick and his work.
3. Explore the surrounding streets and see if you can gather any information from the locals.
4. Return to the telephone booth and see if you can find a way to contact your superiors in the future.
